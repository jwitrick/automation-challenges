For this challenge I have choose to solve it using Ansible.

Assumptions:
 - The package facter is already installed on the client machine(s).
 - The puppet facts 'widget' is installed and accessible on the machine.


Setup:
 - Control machine (local)
   * Install Ansible (http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)
   * Using ssh keys, ensure the ansible machine can connect to the client
     machine as root with out a password prompt.
 - Client machine(s) (remote)
   * Ensure control machine can connect without password prompt.
   * Ensure facter is installed, and configured to allow the command
     'facter -p widget' to run.

How to execute (from the control machine):
1) Checkout the code from the PR
2) Change into the directory
   (automation-challenges/configuration\ management/jwitrick)
3) Modify the file 'ansible_hosts' for each server you want to control
   (one host per line). Note: If DNS is not setup just use the IP address of
   the machine(s).
4) On the control machine run:
   `ansible-playbook -i ansible_hosts main.yml`


Once Ansible finishes running it will show which servers were successfull, and
which ones failed.
